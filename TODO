;;; Absolutely necessary...

* Start work on condition hierarchy. -- DONE

* Get rule salience working. -- DONE

* Add support for TEST conditional element. -- DONE

* CLOS reasoning support. Expand defimport to allow specification of
  relevant slots? -- DONE

;;; Really nice to have...

* Multiple inference engines.

* Multiprocessing support.

* Module support.

;;; Needed, but not desperately...

* Cleaner language/engine interface.

* Rule redefinition.

* Expanded slot-value types (including lists). -- DONE

* Some kind of OR* support, as in

    (rocky (name ?name (or* ?name rocky boris natasha)))

;;; Long-term features...

* Backward-chaining (perhaps).
