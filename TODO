;;; $Id: TODO,v 1.5 2001/05/31 20:20:26 youngde Exp $

;;; Absolutely necessary...

* Start work on condition hierarchy. -- DONE

* Get rule salience working. -- DONE

* Add support for TEST conditional element. -- DONE

* CLOS reasoning support. Expand defimport to allow specification of
  relevant slots? -- DONE

* Documentation, at least a rough reference manual. -- DONE

;;; Really nice to have...

* Multiple inference engines. -- DONE

* Multiprocessing support. -- DONE

* Module support.

* A DEFFACTS macro, like that offered in CLIPS and Jess.

* A query language. Perhaps something similar to Loom's.

;;; Needed, but not desperately...

* Cleaner language/engine interface.

* Rule redefinition.

* Expanded slot-value types (including lists). -- DONE

* Some kind of OR* support, as in

    (rocky (name ?name (or* ?name rocky boris natasha)))

;;; Long-term features...

* Backward-chaining (perhaps).
