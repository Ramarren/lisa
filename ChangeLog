	* This is Lisa release 3.1
	* Added patch for OpenMCL support. I'm not sure who offered this,
	  so I can't offer proper attribution. Sorry.

	* This is Lisa release 3.0.
	* Finally beginning a change log for this project.
	* Added support for SBCL. Thanks to Rusian Kosolapov for
  	  submitting some of the patches for this.
	* Fixed an ugly but subtle bug in Lisa's replace-rule
	  mechanism. Whenever an existing rule was replaced with a new
	  version, the old rule's root nodes were retained rather than being
	  removed, eventually drastically reducing performace. Thanks to
	  Andrew Philpot for analyzing and reporting this problem.
	* Significantly improved the performance of Lisa's conflict
	  resolution machinery. Thanks to Edi Weitz for reporting the
	  problem that led to this work.
	* Streamlined Lisa's rule parser.
	* Made the belief system a permanent part of Lisa. There's a
          keyword arg change DEFRULE -- from :cf to :belief -- that will
	  break existing code. Sorry for that.
