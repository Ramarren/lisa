	Fairly comprehensive multi-processing (thread) support. It should
	now be possible to 1) run multiple inference engines within a Lisp
	world; and 2) have multiple threads access a single inference
	engine. Included with this support is a sample application that
	serves as a decent example; see "lisa:misc;pumps.lisp". This
	application has been tested with the three MP-capable Lisp
	implementations that LISA supports (ACL, LispWorks, CMUCL).

	Syntax change to the DEFTEMPLATE macro in preparation for possible
	future extensions. The proper form is now:

	  (deftemplate ()
	    (slot ...)
	    (...))

	LISA's last alpha release (0.8.2), and the birth of this
	ChangeLog. Latest features include full CLOS reasoning support;
	the TEST conditional element; support for arbitrary list
	constructs within facts and patterns.
