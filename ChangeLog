	* Release 3.1.
	* Fixed bug reported by Andrew Philpot in Lisa's new conflict
	  resolution machinery. The trouble actually lay in the heap
	  library that Lisa borrowed. This bug affected the retrieval and
	  display of activations.
	* Addressed warnings reported by CLISP and Lispworks when
	  compiling Lisa. Lisa now compiles warning-free on these
	  platforms.
	* Added patch for OpenMCL support. I'm not sure who offered this,
	  so I can't offer proper attribution. Sorry.

	* This is Lisa release 3.0.
	* Finally beginning a change log for this project.
	* Added support for SBCL. Thanks to Rusian Kosolapov for
  	  submitting some of the patches for this.
	* Fixed an ugly but subtle bug in Lisa's replace-rule
	  mechanism. Whenever an existing rule was replaced with a new
	  version, the old rule's root nodes were retained rather than being
	  removed, eventually drastically reducing performace. Thanks to
	  Andrew Philpot for analyzing and reporting this problem.
	* Significantly improved the performance of Lisa's conflict
	  resolution machinery. Thanks to Edi Weitz for reporting the
	  problem that led to this work.
	* Streamlined Lisa's rule parser.
	* Made the belief system a permanent part of Lisa. There's a
          keyword arg change DEFRULE -- from :cf to :belief -- that will
	  break existing code. Sorry for that.
