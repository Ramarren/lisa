	LISA release 1.1. Support for dynamic rule definition; small
	additions to the programming interface; additions to
	documentation.

2001-08-31    <de.young@computer.org>

	LISA's first production release, Version 1.0. Support for rule
	redefinition regardless of inference engine state; augmented
	documentation; enhancements to web page.

2001-07-20    <de.young@computer.org>

	Fourth Beta release. Addition of DEFFACTS macro and associated
	documentation.

2001-06-28    <de.young@computer.org>

	Third Beta release. Enhancements to the system definition file
	suggested by Paul Werkowski: LISA creates the binary directory
	hierarchy for all supported implementations, if necessary; other
	minor changes. Addressed implementation differences in
	ENSURE-CLASS. Updated PORT. Tested LISA with Windows versions of
	ACL, LispWorks and CLISP 2.26.

2001-05-31  David E. Young  <de.young@computer.org>

	Second Beta release. Includes a fix to the Rete compiler resulting
	from a bug reported by Art Nuzzo; object ancestry reasoning;
	updated Reference Guide.

2001-05-22  David E. Young  <de.young@computer.org>

	First official Beta release. This distribution adds a reasonable
	LISA Reference Guide that should do a better job of documentation
	than what previously existed. Some small code improvements.

2001-05-10  David E. Young  <de.young@computer.org>

	Fairly comprehensive multi-processing (thread) support. It should
	now be possible to 1) run multiple inference engines within a Lisp
	world; and 2) have multiple threads access a single inference
	engine. Included with this support is a sample application that
	serves as a decent example; see "lisa:misc;pumps.lisp". This
	application has been tested with the three MP-capable Lisp
	implementations that LISA supports (ACL, LispWorks, CMUCL).

	Syntax change to the DEFTEMPLATE macro in preparation for possible
	future extensions. The proper form is now:

	  (deftemplate ()
	    (slot ...)
	    (...))

2001-04-25  David E. Young  <de.young@computer.org>

	LISA's last alpha release (0.8.2), and the birth of this
	ChangeLog. Latest features include full CLOS reasoning support;
	the TEST conditional element; support for arbitrary list
	constructs within facts and patterns.
