This is a fork of Lisp-based Intelligent Software Agents (Lisa) from http://lisa.sourceforge.net/ . The purpose of this fork is primarily to publish it in notCVS, but I also made some changes, the biggest of which is to add back the OR pattern. I have not tested this very heavily, or even at all, so I guarantee nothing.
