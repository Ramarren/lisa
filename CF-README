This is a preliminary document describing Lisa's support for Certainty
Factors (CF).

Lisa now has an implementation of CF as described in Peter Norvig's
Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming (PAIP), chapter 16. I
don't have much to say about it right now, other than PAIP is the
offical reference for the algorithm employed, and that the MYCIN
example in that book has been partially replicated for Lisa; you'll
find it in "lisa:misc;mycin.lisp".

The Lisa MYCIN example contains the full set of rules found in PAIP,
plus two functions: CULTURE-1 and CULTURE-2. These two functions set
up the environment found on pgs 555-556, eliminating the need for user
interaction. They produce the results found in the book.

I'm not going to write any documentation until we've finished the
implementation. It's possible I'll add support for Dempster-Shafer
theory and Baye's law, if I can find the time in my life, and that
will require refactoring the existing interfaces.

If you're interested in the code, changes occurred in these files:

  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;cf.lisp" (new file)
  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;language.lisp"
  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;parser.lisp"
  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;rete.lisp"
  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;fact.lisp"
  * "lisa:src;2.0-core;rule.lisp"
  * "lisa:src;package;pkgdecl.lisp"

Look at mycin.lisp to see how CF is employed in Lisa.

Please report bugs to me; I'll try and fix them in a timely manner.
