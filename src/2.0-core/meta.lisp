;;; facts and instances.

;;; NB: A note on terminology. We make the distinction here between symbolic
;;; slot names and effective slot names. The former refers to an internal
;;; symbol, created by LISA, used to identify fact slots within rules; the
;;; latter refers to the actual, package-qualified slot name.
