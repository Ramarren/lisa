;;; File: clos.lisp
;;; Description: Contains code and data structures that provide some ancillary
;;; support for CLOS reasoning. You'll find this stuff globally (rather than
;;; within, say, class RETE) because LISA assumes responsibility for managing
;;; the instance->engine bindings, which are especially needed whenever a CLOS
;;; object is modified outside of LISA's control (triggering the notification
;;; protocol). This is especially convenient when the application is running
;;; multiple inference engines and a single CLOS instance can reside in more
;;; than one.
