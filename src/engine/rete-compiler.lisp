;;; Description: This class generates the Rete pattern network.

;;; See the paper "Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many
;;; Object Pattern Match Problem", Charles L. Forgy, Artificial
;;; Intelligence 19 (1982), 17-37.

;;; The implementation used here is an adaptation of that used in the
;;; Java Expert System Shell (JESS), Ernest Friedman-Hill, Sandia
;;; National Labs. As such, it does not follow Forgy's paper. Rather,
;;; LISA "models the Rete net more literally as a set of networked
;;; Node objects with interconnections."
