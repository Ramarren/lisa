;;; Description: Interfaces to the CLOCC multiprocessing library. If the Lisp
;;; implementation does not support MP, then the interfaces are either no-ops
;;; or signal an error. The idea here is that core LISA can transparently
;;; support some "virtual" MP functionality (particularly mutexes) regardless
;;; of the underlying Lisp platform. For example, LISA can safely invoke
;;; things like WITH-LOCK without considering whether or not Lisp MP support
;;; is available. Of course, this does NOT hold for functions like
;;; MAKE-PROCESS; in cases like this we defer to the underlying behavior of
;;; CLOCC.

;;; NB: This stuff is NOT intended for consumption outside of core LISA.
