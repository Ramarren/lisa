<h1>Release Notes for LISA 2.0</h1>
<h2>The LISA Project</h2>
<h3><b>10 December, 2002</b></h3>
<p>Release 2.0.1, a bug-fix release to correct a problem reported in the Rete
network that prevented rules such as the following from activating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(defrule frodo ()<br>
&nbsp; (?a (relation))<br>
&nbsp; (?b (relation))<br>
&nbsp; (test (not (eq ?a ?b)))<br>
&nbsp; =&gt;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a consequence, there's a semantic change. If the first two patterns of a
rule have the same class (i.e. are matching the same template or class name),
then a RESET must&nbsp; have been issued prior to running the engine.</p>
<h3>9 December, 2002</h3>
<p>The first production release for LISA 2.0. One major new feature, and some
small enhancements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Auto Notification (AN), a mechanism used to monitor changes to CLOS
    instances in working memory that occur outside of LISA (i.e. somewhere else
    in the application). Normally, LISA must be explicitly told about these
    changes via the function <i>lisa:mark-instance-as-changed</i>; when an
    application alters the contents of an instance’s slots, it must inform
    LISA about the changes so the inference engine can maintain the consistency
    of working memory. Auto Notification obviates this requirement; LISA hooks
    into the MOP slot access protocol and notices slot changes without
    application intervention. This is an experimental feature, and requires a
    Common Lisp with a robust MOP implementation. As of this writing, only
    Allegro (6.2) and LispWorks (4.2) are supported [note that earlier versions
    of ACL and LW will probably also work; I just haven't tested AN with
    anything else]. AN for CLISP will <i>not</i> be available until CLISP's MOP
    is more complete; AN for CMUCL is also not supported as I don't have ready
    access to a platform that runs CMUCL. There's more on Auto Notification in
    the reference guide.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Both <i>assert-instance</i> and <i>retract-instance</i>, deprecated in
    2.0b2, have been &quot;undeprecated&quot;. I've also added the #? dispatch
    macro character to offer yet another way to add CLOS instances to working
    memory via <i>assert</i>. See the documentation for <i>assert</i> in the
    reference guide.</li>
</ul>
<h3>25 November, 2002</h3>
<p>The third beta release for 2.0 further extends LISA's capabilities. New to
this version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contexts, a mechanism for partitioning a knowledge base into distinct
    collections of related rules, each with its own agenda and conflict set.
    Contexts are similar to Jess and CLIPS modules.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The EXISTS conditional element.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Duplicate fact detection. LISA now offers the option of performing
    duplicate detection during fact assertion, bringing its behavior more in
    line with CLIPS and Jess.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Some new &quot;introspection&quot; functions in the API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless bugs are reported, 2.0b3 will be released again as the official 2.0
production version, probably with an additional experimental feature yet to be
revealed. See the Reference Guide for details on the new features.</p>
<h3>18 November, 2002</h3>
<p>The second beta release for 2.0, 2.0b2, offers a number of significant
enhancements. Some of these might break existing code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Truth maintenance has been completed. Negated patterns are now allowed
    within LOGICAL forms, lifting the restriction imposed by the initial TMS
    implementation. Beware removing or redefining rules that have active logical
    dependencies, however; this is not (yet) supported. Also, there are
    restrictions on where the LOGICAL operator may appear within a DEFRULE form.
    See the Reference Guide for details.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The ASSERT and RETRACT macros now operate on both template and CLOS
    instances.&nbsp; ASSERT-INSTANCE and RETRACT-INSTANCE have been deprecated.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The last remaining (known) concurrency issues have been addressed. As a
    side effect, LISA delays validating asserted facts (i.e. looking for their
    meta data) until assertion time. To assist developers, LISA will signal a
    continuable error if an attempt is made to assert a template fact that was
    not previously defined.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>DEFIMPORT is no longer required. And indeed, its semantics have changed.
    If a class is either defined in, or imported into, a package of rules, then
    LISA will discover it automatically upon assertion of the first instance.
    Note that if a class is imported then its name <i>and all required slots</i>
    must be imported as well. DEFIMPORT is now a convenience macro that may be
    used to handle those details.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>USE-DEFAULT-ENGINE is deprecated. LISA now creates an initial inference
    engine instance when first loaded.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Inheritance reasoning, or the consideration of an object's taxonomy during
    pattern matching, is now an &quot;all or nothing&quot; deal. In other words,
    this behavior is either enabled or disabled globally rather than on a
    class-by-class basis. By default, taxonomic reasoning is disabled; if you
    want this behavior evaluate the form (CONSIDER-TAXONOMY) prior to asserting
    any facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I've remembered everything. This will likely be LISA's last beta
before the official 2.0 production release. In the interim, I'll probably begin
writing a document describing LISA's implementation of the Rete algorithm, for
posterity if nothing else.</p>
<h3>6 November, 2002</h3>
<p>LISA 2.0's first beta release, 2.0b1. This version introduces LISA's notion
of truth maintenance, implemented via the new LOGICAL conditional element. The
reference guide contains details.</p>
<h3>4 November, 2002</h3>
<p>Alpha release five. This version introduces the OR conditional element, along
with some improvements to the LISA debugger. The reference guide in the
distribution contains details.</p>
<h3>28 October, 2002</h3>
<p>Alpha release four. This version introduces the LISA debugger, a simple
monitoring and inspection facility for production rules. There is documentation
for this feature in the 2.0 reference guide. Well, it's actually the 1.x guide
with debugger documentation grafted in. I haven't yet gone through the document and updated it for the rest of 2.0.</p>
<h3>20 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the third alpha release for LISA version 2.0, following closely on
the heels of 2.0a2 because I had a bit more time than anticipated to spend on
it. The last remaining missing 1.x features have been added; these are 1) a
basic watch mechanism; and 2) embedded rule definitions (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
rule RHSs). The 2.0 branch remains a much improved implementation over 1.x, and
should offer a solid foundation for any future LISA development.</p>
<h3>17 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the second alpha release for LISA version 2.0. Rule redefinition and
queries are now in place, with improved performance and efficiency. In the case
of rule redefinition, or rule insertion into a &quot;live&quot; engine, LISA now
builds a &quot;mini Rete network&quot; for the new rule and grafts it into the
larger network. Also new are rewritten ASSERT and MODIFY macros, allowing code
similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>(let ((?age 1000))</dt>
    <dt>&nbsp; (modify ?fact (age ?age) (name (make-a-name))))</dt>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, ASSERT and MODIFY should now respond better to their lexical
environments.</p>
<h3>1 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the first alpha release for LISA version 2.0, representing a
significant improvement over the 1.x branch. At the core of 2.0 is a ground-up
rewrite of LISA's Rete algorithm. While CLOS still forms the basic structure of
the algorithm, 2.0 makes extensive use of closures and function objects,
yielding a more &quot;lispy&quot; feel to the implementation. The second
significant departure from 1.x is a redesigned language parser, with particular
attention paid to the analysis of DEFRULE forms. While the 1.x parser performs
multi-pass transformations over DEFRULEs, the new parser is a single-pass
implementation that collects more structural information &quot;up-front&quot;
before sending the output to the Rete compiler.</p>
<p>By incorporating the algorithmic and parsing changes mentioned above, a
significant amount of code has been eliminated from 2.0. In particular, the
entire 1.x binding mechanism, used to establish variable bindings in production
rules and support rule firings, has been replaced by closures. Closures also
form the basis of various types of intra- and inter-pattern node tests, making
possible a reduction in the number of classes required to implement nodes in the
Rete network. These two changes alone make for a dramatic improvement in code
readability, simplicity, and application performance.</p>
<p>Some features present in 1.x have not yet been adapted to 2.0. These are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rule redefinition, including runtime rule creation (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
    rule RHSs).</li>
  <li>Query support.</li>
  <li>Debugging support, including watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>This first alpha release is intended to give developers a chance to try their
rule sets with the new algorithm and parser, and expose any remaining bugs. LISA
2.0 is able to successfully run the sample MAB problems included in the
distribution, but exposure to other rule sets is vital to ensuring the stability
of forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 contains its own DEFSYSTEM file, lisa2.system. Building 2.0 is
very similar to how one builds 1.x; the system name is LISA2 rather than LISA.
So, something like (mk:compile-system :lisa2) should work for you. The 2.0 code
base is kept separate from 1.x; you'll notice two new directories in the source
tree; 2.0-core contains the core system files, rete/reference contains those
files strictly associated with the 2.0 Rete implementation.</p>
<p>This alpha version of 2.0 has been tested with ACL 6.2 and CLISP 2.29, both
on Windows 2000.</p>
