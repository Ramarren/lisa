<h1>Release Notes for LISA 2.0</h1>

<h2>The LISA Project</h2>

<h3>10 December, 2002</h3>

<p>Release 2.0.2, another bug-fix release that introduces a proper fix for the
incomplete fix found in 2.0.1. The caveat regarding RESET no longer applies. Sigh…
I apologize for this; there are a number of large trees sitting in my home,
placed there by our recent ice storm, and I should have known better than to
make a release under these circumstances.</p>

<h3>9 December, 2002</h3>

<p>Release 2.0.1, a bug-fix release to correct a problem reported in the Rete
network that prevented rules such as the following from activating:</p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'>(defrule frodo ()<br>
&nbsp; (?a (relation))<br>
&nbsp; (?b (relation))<br>
&nbsp; (test (not (eq ?a ?b)))<br>
&nbsp; =&gt;)</p>

<p>As a consequence, there's a semantic change. If the first two patterns of a
rule have the same class (i.e. are matching the same template or class name),
then a RESET must&nbsp; have been issued prior to running the engine.</p>

<h3>9 December, 2002</h3>

<p>The first production release for LISA 2.0. One major new feature, and some
small enhancements:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Auto Notification (AN), a
     mechanism used to monitor changes to CLOS instances in working memory that
     occur outside of LISA (i.e. somewhere else in the application). Normally,
     LISA must be explicitly told about these changes via the function <i>lisa:mark-instance-as-changed</i>;
     when an application alters the contents of an instance’s slots, it must
     inform LISA about the changes so the inference engine can maintain the
     consistency of working memory. Auto Notification obviates this
     requirement; LISA hooks into the MOP slot access protocol and notices slot
     changes without application intervention. This is an experimental feature,
     and requires a Common Lisp with a robust MOP implementation. As of this
     writing, only Allegro (6.2) and LispWorks (4.2) are supported [note that
     earlier versions of ACL and LW will probably also work; I just haven't
     tested AN with anything else]. AN for CLISP will <i>not</i> be available
     until CLISP's MOP is more complete; AN for CMUCL is also not supported as
     I don't have ready access to a platform that runs CMUCL. There's more on
     Auto Notification in the reference guide.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in'>Both <i>assert-instance</i>
     and <i>retract-instance</i>, deprecated in 2.0b2, have been
     &quot;undeprecated&quot;. I've also added the #? dispatch macro character
     to offer yet another way to add CLOS instances to working memory via <i>assert</i>.
     See the documentation for <i>assert</i> in the reference guide.</li>
</ul>

<h3>25 November, 2002</h3>

<p>The third beta release for 2.0 further extends LISA's capabilities. New to
this version:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Contexts, a mechanism for
     partitioning a knowledge base into distinct collections of related rules,
     each with its own agenda and conflict set. Contexts are similar to Jess
     and CLIPS modules.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>The EXISTS conditional
     element.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Duplicate fact detection.
     LISA now offers the option of performing duplicate detection during fact
     assertion, bringing its behavior more in line with CLIPS and Jess.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in'>Some new &quot;introspection&quot;
     functions in the API.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless bugs are reported, 2.0b3 will be released again as the official 2.0
production version, probably with an additional experimental feature yet to be
revealed. See the Reference Guide for details on the new features.</p>

<h3>18 November, 2002</h3>

<p>The second beta release for 2.0, 2.0b2, offers a number of significant
enhancements. Some of these might break existing code:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>Truth maintenance has been
     completed. Negated patterns are now allowed within LOGICAL forms, lifting
     the restriction imposed by the initial TMS implementation. Beware removing
     or redefining rules that have active logical dependencies, however; this
     is not (yet) supported. Also, there are restrictions on where the LOGICAL
     operator may appear within a DEFRULE form. See the Reference Guide for
     details.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>The ASSERT and RETRACT macros
     now operate on both template and CLOS instances.&nbsp; ASSERT-INSTANCE and
     RETRACT-INSTANCE have been deprecated.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>The last remaining (known)
     concurrency issues have been addressed. As a side effect, LISA delays
     validating asserted facts (i.e. looking for their meta data) until
     assertion time. To assist developers, LISA will signal a continuable error
     if an attempt is made to assert a template fact that was not previously
     defined.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>DEFIMPORT is no longer
     required. And indeed, its semantics have changed. If a class is either
     defined in, or imported into, a package of rules, then LISA will discover
     it automatically upon assertion of the first instance. Note that if a
     class is imported then its name <i>and all required slots</i> must be
     imported as well. DEFIMPORT is now a convenience macro that may be used to
     handle those details.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;margin-bottom:12.0pt;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>USE-DEFAULT-ENGINE is
     deprecated. LISA now creates an initial inference engine instance when
     first loaded.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in'>Inheritance reasoning, or the
     consideration of an object's taxonomy during pattern matching, is now an
     &quot;all or nothing&quot; deal. In other words, this behavior is either
     enabled or disabled globally rather than on a class-by-class basis. By
     default, taxonomic reasoning is disabled; if you want this behavior
     evaluate the form (CONSIDER-TAXONOMY) prior to asserting any facts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope I've remembered everything. This will likely be LISA's last beta
before the official 2.0 production release. In the interim, I'll probably begin
writing a document describing LISA's implementation of the Rete algorithm, for
posterity if nothing else.</p>

<h3>6 November, 2002</h3>

<p>LISA 2.0's first beta release, 2.0b1. This version introduces LISA's notion
of truth maintenance, implemented via the new LOGICAL conditional element. The
reference guide contains details.</p>

<h3>4 November, 2002</h3>

<p>Alpha release five. This version introduces the OR conditional element,
along with some improvements to the LISA debugger. The reference guide in the
distribution contains details.</p>

<h3>28 October, 2002</h3>

<p>Alpha release four. This version introduces the LISA debugger, a simple
monitoring and inspection facility for production rules. There is documentation
for this feature in the 2.0 reference guide. Well, it's actually the 1.x guide
with debugger documentation grafted in. I haven't yet gone through the document
and updated it for the rest of 2.0.</p>

<h3>20 October, 2002</h3>

<p>This is the third alpha release for LISA version 2.0, following closely on
the heels of 2.0a2 because I had a bit more time than anticipated to spend on
it. The last remaining missing 1.x features have been added; these are 1) a
basic watch mechanism; and 2) embedded rule definitions (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
rule RHSs). The 2.0 branch remains a much improved implementation over 1.x, and
should offer a solid foundation for any future LISA development.</p>

<h3>17 October, 2002</h3>

<p>This is the second alpha release for LISA version 2.0. Rule redefinition and
queries are now in place, with improved performance and efficiency. In the case
of rule redefinition, or rule insertion into a &quot;live&quot; engine, LISA
now builds a &quot;mini Rete network&quot; for the new rule and grafts it into
the larger network. Also new are rewritten ASSERT and MODIFY macros, allowing
code similar to the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>(let ((?age 1000))</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp; (modify ?fact (age ?age) (name
(make-a-name))))</p>

<p>In other words, ASSERT and MODIFY should now respond better to their lexical
environments.</p>

<h3>1 October, 2002</h3>

<p>This is the first alpha release for LISA version 2.0, representing a
significant improvement over the 1.x branch. At the core of 2.0 is a ground-up
rewrite of LISA's Rete algorithm. While CLOS still forms the basic structure of
the algorithm, 2.0 makes extensive use of closures and function objects,
yielding a more &quot;lispy&quot; feel to the implementation. The second
significant departure from 1.x is a redesigned language parser, with particular
attention paid to the analysis of DEFRULE forms. While the 1.x parser performs
multi-pass transformations over DEFRULEs, the new parser is a single-pass
implementation that collects more structural information &quot;up-front&quot;
before sending the output to the Rete compiler.</p>

<p>By incorporating the algorithmic and parsing changes mentioned above, a
significant amount of code has been eliminated from 2.0. In particular, the
entire 1.x binding mechanism, used to establish variable bindings in production
rules and support rule firings, has been replaced by closures. Closures also
form the basis of various types of intra- and inter-pattern node tests, making
possible a reduction in the number of classes required to implement nodes in
the Rete network. These two changes alone make for a dramatic improvement in
code readability, simplicity, and application performance.</p>

<p>Some features present in 1.x have not yet been adapted to 2.0. These are:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Rule redefinition, including
     runtime rule creation (i.e. DEFRULE forms on rule RHSs).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Query support.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4;tab-stops:list .5in'>Debugging support, including
     watches.</li>
</ol>

<p>This first alpha release is intended to give developers a chance to try
their rule sets with the new algorithm and parser, and expose any remaining
bugs. LISA 2.0 is able to successfully run the sample MAB problems included in
the distribution, but exposure to other rule sets is vital to ensuring the
stability of forthcoming releases.</p>

<p>Version 2.0 contains its own DEFSYSTEM file, lisa2.system. Building 2.0 is
very similar to how one builds 1.x; the system name is LISA2 rather than LISA.
So, something like (mk:compile-system :lisa2) should work for you. The 2.0 code
base is kept separate from 1.x; you'll notice two new directories in the source
tree; 2.0-core contains the core system files, rete/reference contains those
files strictly associated with the 2.0 Rete implementation.</p>

<p>This alpha version of 2.0 has been tested with ACL 6.2 and CLISP 2.29, both
on Windows 2000.</p>
