<h2>
The LISA Reference Guide</h2></center>
This guide describes in detail the programming interface to LISA. It is
<i>not</i> a treatise on production-rule technology; readers are assumed
to have a working knowledge of rule-based systems and their development.
This document also avoids any detailed description of LISA's implementation
of the Rete algorithm; perhaps at some future date I'll make an attempt.
