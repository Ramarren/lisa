<h2>
The LISA Reference Guide</h2></center>
This guide describes in detail the programming interface to LISA. It is
<i>not</i> a treatise on production-rule technology; readers are assumed
to have a working knowledge of rule-based systems and their development.
This document also avoids any detailed description of LISA's implementation
of the Rete algorithm; perhaps at some future date I'll make an attempt.

<h3>
I. The Programming Language</h3>
This section describes the publicly-available operators in the LISA language,
separated into various categories.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Rule-related Operators</h4>

<blockquote>Creates a rule identified by <i>name</i> and compiles it into
the Rete network. The keyword arguments modify the rule as follows:
<pre>:salience <i>integer</i></pre>

<blockquote>Assigns a priority to the rule that will affect the firing
order. The salience value is a small integer in the range (-250, 250).
By default, all rules have salience 0.</blockquote>

<pre>:module <i>name</i></pre>

<blockquote>Binds the rule to a module identified by the symbol <i>name</i>.
Currently unimplemented.</blockquote>
Each rule consists of zero or more <i>pattern</i>s, or Conditional Elements
(CEs). Collectively these patterns are known as the rule's Left Hand Side
(LHS), and are the entities that participate in the pattern-matching process.
LISA currently defines three pattern types:
<pre>generic pattern</pre>

<blockquote>This pattern type matches against facts in the knowledge base.
The head of the pattern matches equivalently-named facts; the pattern body
is optionally composed of slot-names, values, variables and predicates.
The best way to understand these things is to look at some examples:
<pre>(simple-pattern)</pre>
