<h3>
LISA Project Documentation</h3></center>

<p><br>This page is a haphazard attempt to generate some early documentation
for LISA, in preparation for an alpha release. It is nowhere near comprehensive,
and at some point in the near future will be completely rewritten.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
I. What can LISA do right now?</h4>
As of this writing, LISA is capabile of running "smallish" rulesets similar
in composition to the "monkey and bananas" (MAB) planning problem, a version
of which can be found in the project's <i>misc</i> directory. It is possible
to interact with LISA in much the way one interacts with JESS and CLIPS;
there's a fairly decent programming and command language (mentioned later)
that one can use to inspect the knowledge base, fire rules, save facts
to a file, etc. It is <i>not</i> possible, I believe, to build even a small
system suitable for deployment; there are simply too many missing features.
However, one can get a good feel for the environment right now, so I think
in that sense a software release at this point is reasonable.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
II. What can't LISA do right now?</h4>
This list is long, but development continues at a pretty good clip. In
no particular order, missing features include but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>
<i>True reasoning over CLOS objects</i>: Right now LISA performs what I
call "symbolic reasoning". This means that rule patterns (and facts in
the knowledge base) manipulate the equivalent of JESS <i>unordered facts</i>,
or <i>deftemplates</i>. Although each fact name must be backed by a CLOS
class, LISA doesn't do anything with these classes right now. You'll see
how this works in the MAB example.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Rule salience</i>: All rules operate at the same salience, or priority.
LISA's conflict resolution strategy is ready for this feature; I just need
to tweak the rule parser a bit.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>No TEST conditional element</i>.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>No rule redefinition</i>: LISA doesn't yet support dynamic redefinition
of rules. Before reloading an existing knowledge base one must first CLEAR
the inference engine.&nbsp;Failing to do this will hose the Rete network
pretty good.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>No multiprocessing support</i>: LISA will eventually support this feature
but the implementation requires some thought.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>Limited fact slot values</i>: Right now LISA limits the values fact
slots can possess to '(string, number, symbol). In particular, lists are
not yet supported.<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>Patterns like this</i>: LISA currently doesn't support patterns like
(<b>pattern-1 (slot-1 ?var) (slot-2 ?var))</b>, where <b>?var</b> first
occurs in <b>pattern-1</b> and multiple times within its slots.&nbsp;Is
this clear enough?<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>No ruleset partitioning</i>: LISA doesn't yet support the notion of
rule "modules" or "packets".<br>
<BR></li>

<li>
<i>No backward chaining</i>: LISA employs a forward-chaining inference
engine. I might support backward-chaining in the future.<br>
<BR></li>

</ol>
