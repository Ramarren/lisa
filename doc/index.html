<b>LISA - Intelligent Software Agents for Common Lisp</b></h2></center>

<p><br>Welcome to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">LISA</a>
project, a platform for the development of <b>L</b>isp-based <b>I</b>ntelligent
<b>S</b>oftware
<b>A</b>gents.
LISA is a production-rule system implemented in the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS), and is heavily influenced by the
<a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess">Java
Expert System Shell </a>(JESS). At its core is a reasoning engine based
on an object-oriented implementation of the Rete algorithm, a very efficient
mechanism for solving the difficult many-to-many matching problem ("Rete:
A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem",
Charles L. Forgy, Artificial Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.) Intrinsic to
LISA is the ability to reason over CLOS objects without imposing special
class hierarchy requirements; thus it should be possible to easily augment
existing CLOS applications with reasoning capabilities. As LISA is an extension
to Common Lisp, the full power of the Lisp environment is always available.
LISA-enabled applications should run on any ANSI-compliant Common Lisp
platform.
<h3>
<b>Project Goals</b></h3>
The LISA project is driven by a number of important goals:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<i>Unrestricted availability</i>: The principal motivation for beginning
LISA was the apparent dearth of lightweight, <i>current, freely-available</i>
toolkits for constructing Lisp-based intelligent systems. There are a number
of very fine commercial and restricted-use products out there (see the
links below), but these systems do not necessarily address the needs of
the Open Source community.</li>

<li>
<i>Portability</i>: Vendor neutrality is a significant project goal. As
previously mentioned, LISA is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp; currently,
all development is being done on Xanalys <a href="http://www.xanalys.com">LispWorks</a>
and <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a>, with concurrent validation
on <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl">CMU Common Lisp</a> (CMUCL) and
<a href="http://www.franz.com">Allegro
Common Lisp</a>. Every effort will be made to avoid the use of implementation-specific
functionality; in the cases where a non-ANSI feature must be used (e.g.
multiprocessing support), LISA will attempt to support the major Lisp implementations
through conditional evaluation.</li>

<li>
<i>Familiarity</i>: LISA's production-rule system has its roots in CLIPS
and JESS, making it readily familiar to developers who've worked with either
of these systems. Indeed, the CLIPS and JESS languages both have their
roots in Lisp.</li>

<li>
<i>Flexibility</i>: As previously mentioned, LISA reasons over CLOS objects
without requiring changes to an application's class hierarchy. In addition,
the full power of Common Lisp is available for use within productions;
there is no dichotomy between LISA's programming language and her implementation.</li>

<li>
<i>Simplicity</i>: Along with portability, the project is striving for
simplicity and elegance at the functional, architecture and source code
levels. This doesn't mean LISA should have limited usefulness; rather,
it should be possible for new developers to easily understand the code
layout and behavior. Unless performance absolutely demands otherwise, clarity
of design and implementation will take precedence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Project Status</h3>
LISA is approaching the middle stages of development and is now considered
"alpha" software. The inference engine itself is quite stable, and it should
be possible to develop reasonably sophisiticated knowledge bases for experimentation.
As of 1 March 2001, LISA successfully runs an adaptation of the "monkey
and bananas" (MAB) planning problem on all three target Lisp platforms
(to see the source code for LISA's version of the MAB, click <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab.lisp">here</a>);
development effort is now concentrated on stabilising the code and preparing
preliminary documentation that will support an alpha release of the software.
For the most current information on the project, including mailing lists,
latest news and available downloads, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">official
project page</a>. If you prefer, you can contact the project staff directly
(see
<i>Project People</i>).

Related Links</h3>
This section contains a small collection of topics related to LISA and
her development environment. It will be updated periodically as the need
arises. NB: If your favorite Lisp/Environment/Tool was omitted here it
was done without prejudice; I simply haven't had time to test LISA with
every mainstream Lisp implementation, or investigate every knowledge representation
system, or... you get the idea.
