<h2>
<b>LISA - Intelligent Software Agents for Common Lisp</b></h2></center>

<p><br>Welcome to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">LISA</a>
project, a platform for the development of <b>L</b>isp-based <b>I</b>ntelligent
<b>S</b>oftware
<b>A</b>gents.
LISA is a production-rule system implemented in the Common Lisp Object
System (CLOS), and is heavily influenced by CLIPS and the Java Expert System
Shell (JESS). At its core is a reasoning engine based on an object-oriented
implementation of the Rete algorithm, a very efficient mechanism for solving
the difficult many-to-many matching problem ("Rete: A Fast Algorithm for
the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem", Charles L. Forgy,
Artificial Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.) Intrinsic to LISA is the ability
to reason over CLOS objects without imposing special class hierarchy requirements;
thus it should be possible to easily augment existing CLOS applications
with reasoning capabilities. As LISA is an extension to Common Lisp, the
full power of the Lisp environment is always available. LISA-enabled applications
should run on any ANSI-compliant Common Lisp platform.
<h3>
<b>Project Goals</b></h3>
The LISA project is driven by a number of important goals:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<i>Unrestricted availability</i>: The principal motivation for beginning
LISA was the apparent dearth of lightweight, <i>current, freely-available</i>
toolkits for constructing Lisp-based intelligent systems. There are a number
of very fine commercial and restricted-use products out there (see the
links below), but these systems do not necessarily address the needs of
the Open Source community.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Portability</i>: Vendor neutrality is a significant project goal. As
previously mentioned, LISA is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp; currently,
all development is being done on Linux using&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xanalys.com">Xanalys</a>'
LispWorks and <a href="http://www.franz.com">Franz</a>'s Allegro Common
Lisp. In addition, concurrent validation is performed with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl">CMU
Common Lisp</a> (CMUCL) and <a href="http://clisp.cons.org">CLISP</a>&nbsp;
to gain more complete coverage. Every effort will be made to avoid the
use of implementation-specific functionality; in the cases where a non-ANSI
feature must be used (e.g. multiprocessing support), LISA will attempt
to support the major Lisp implementations either through conditional evaluation
or the use of a common library such as <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">CLOCC</a>.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Familiarity</i>: LISA's production-rule system has its roots in CLIPS
and JESS, making it readily familiar to developers who've worked with either
of these systems. Indeed, the CLIPS and JESS languages both have their
roots in Lisp.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Flexibility</i>: As previously mentioned, LISA reasons over CLOS objects
without requiring changes to an application's class hierarchy. In addition,
the full power of Common Lisp is available for use within productions;
there is no dichotomy between LISA's programming language and her implementation.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<i>Simplicity</i>: Along with portability, the project is striving for
simplicity and elegance at the functional, architecture and source code
levels. This doesn't mean LISA should have limited usefulness; rather,
it should be possible for new developers to easily understand the code
layout and behavior. Unless performance absolutely demands otherwise, clarity
of design and implementation will take precedence.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Project People</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="mailto:de.young@computer.org">David E. Young</a>: I've been a
senior engineer at Fujitsu for just over five years. As of 1 June our Raleigh
facility is closing and I'll be moving on to better opportunities. If you
want to know more about me technically, have a look at my <a href="http://resumes.dice.com/youngde">resume</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Project Status</h3>
LISA is approaching the middle stages of development and is now considered
"beta" software. The inference engine itself is quite stable, and it should
be possible to develop reasonably sophisticated knowledge bases for experimentation.
As of 1 March 2001, LISA successfully ran an adaptation of the "monkey
and bananas" (MAB) planning problem on all four target Lisp platforms;
since the alpha release announcement, development has progressed to the
point where LISA is now able to reason over CLOS instances in a multi-threaded
environment. For the most current information on the project, including
mailing lists, latest news and available downloads, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">official
project page</a>. If you prefer, you may contact the project staff directly
(see
<i>Project People</i>).
<h3>
Documentation</h3>
Currently, documentation for LISA is a work-in-progress. However, there
is an beta-quality version of the <a href="ref-guide.html">LISA Reference
Guide</a> that should help you get started. Also, you may see the source
code for LISA's two versions of the MAB, <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab.lisp">mab.lisp</a>
and <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab-clos.lisp">mab-clos.lisp</a>
(a "CLOS-ified" version of the default MAB implementation).
<h3>
Related Links</h3>
This section contains a small collection of topics related to LISA and
her development environment. It will be updated periodically as the need
arises. NB: If your favorite Lisp/Environment/Tool was omitted here it
was done without prejudice; I simply haven't had time to test LISA with
every mainstream Lisp implementation, or investigate every knowledge representation
system, or... you get the idea.
