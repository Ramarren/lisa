<b>LISA - Intelligent Software Agents for Common Lisp</b></h2></center>



<p><br>Welcome to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">LISA</a>

project, a platform for the development of <b>L</b>isp-based <b>I</b>ntelligent

<b>S</b>oftware

<b>A</b>gents.

LISA is a production-rule system implemented in the Common Lisp Object

System (CLOS), and is heavily influenced by CLIPS and the Java Expert System

Shell (JESS). At its core is a reasoning engine based on an object-oriented

implementation of the Rete algorithm, a very efficient mechanism for solving

the difficult many-to-many matching problem ("Rete: A Fast Algorithm for

the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem", Charles L. Forgy,

Artificial Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.) Intrinsic to LISA is the ability

to reason over CLOS objects without imposing special class hierarchy requirements;

thus it should be possible to easily augment existing CLOS applications

with reasoning capabilities. As LISA is an extension to Common Lisp, the

full power of the Lisp environment is always available. LISA-enabled applications

should run on any ANSI-compliant Common Lisp platform.

<h3>

<b>Project Goals</b></h3>

The LISA project is driven by a number of important goals:

<ul>

<li>

<i>Unrestricted availability</i>: The principal motivation for beginning

LISA was the apparent dearth of lightweight, <i>current, freely-available</i>

toolkits for constructing Lisp-based intelligent systems. There are a number

of very fine commercial and restricted-use products out there (see the

links below), but these systems do not necessarily address the needs of

the Open Source community.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Portability</i>: Vendor neutrality is a significant project goal. As

previously mentioned, LISA is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp; currently,

all development is being done on Linux using&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xanalys.com">Xanalys</a>'

LispWorks and <a href="http://www.franz.com">Franz</a>'s Allegro Common

Lisp. In addition, concurrent validation is performed with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl">CMU

Common Lisp</a> (CMUCL) and <a href="http://clisp.cons.org">CLISP</a>&nbsp;

to gain more complete coverage. Every effort will be made to avoid the

use of implementation-specific functionality; in the cases where a non-ANSI

feature must be used (e.g. multiprocessing support), LISA will attempt

to support the major Lisp implementations either through conditional evaluation

or the use of a common library such as <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">CLOCC</a>.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Familiarity</i>: LISA's production-rule system has its roots in CLIPS

and JESS, making it readily familiar to developers who've worked with either

of these systems. Indeed, the CLIPS and JESS languages both have their

roots in Lisp.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Flexibility</i>: As previously mentioned, LISA reasons over CLOS objects

without requiring changes to an application's class hierarchy. In addition,

the full power of Common Lisp is available for use within productions;

there is no dichotomy between LISA's programming language and her implementation.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Simplicity</i>: Along with portability, the project is striving for

simplicity and elegance at the functional, architecture and source code

levels. This doesn't mean LISA should have limited usefulness; rather,

it should be possible for new developers to easily understand the code

layout

and behavior. Unless performance absolutely demands otherwise, clarity

of design and implementation will take precedence.</li>

</ul>

<h3>

Project Status</h3>

LISA had its first production release (Version 1.0) on 31 August, 2001

and is considered "stable" software; it should now be possible to develop

reasonably sophisticated knowledge bases for Real Systems. LISA has successfully

run adaptations of the "monkey and bananas" (MAB) planning problem on all

four target Lisp platforms, and full reasoning capabilities are available

for CLOS objects in a multi-threaded environment. Release 1.1 offers support

for <i>dynamic rule definition</i>, the ability to create new rules from

existing rules at runtime; version 1.2 includes a new query facility that

allows interactive and programmatic retrieval of CLOS instances from a knowledge

base. Currently, development efforts are concentrated on completely documenting

the source code. For the most current information on the project, including

mailing lists, latest news and available downloads, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">official

project page</a>. If you prefer, you may contact the project staff directly

(see

<i>Project People</i>).

<h3>

Documentation</h3>

Currently, documentation for LISA is a work-in-progress. However, there

is a beta-quality version of the <a href="ref-guide.html">LISA Reference

Guide</a> that should help you get started. Also, you may see the source

code for LISA's two versions of the MAB, <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab.lisp">mab.lisp</a>

and <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab-clos.lisp">mab-clos.lisp</a>

(a "CLOS-ified" version of the default MAB implementation).

News</h3>

<i>20 October, 2002</i>: LISA 2.0's third, and possibly last, alpha release is
now available. See the <a href="RELNOTES.html">release notes</a> for new
features.
<p>

<i>17 October, 2002</i>: LISA 2.0's second alpha release is now available. See
the <a href="RELNOTES.html">release notes</a> for details.</p>
<p>

<i>1 October, 2002</i>: The first 2.0 alpha release, 2.0a1, is now available
from the project site. See the <a href="RELNOTES.html">release notes</a> for a
brief description.</p>
<p>

<i>30 September, 2002</i>: LISA 2.0 successfully ran the MAB today. This version
contains a ground-up reimplementation of Rete, plus an improved parsing engine.
The new algorithm appears to be about twice as fast as the 1.x version, but I
haven't confirmed this. An alpha release for 2.0 will be released soon.</p>
<p>

<i>17 August, 2002</i>: A significant change in the project direction. LISA's
most recent bug report, involving a subtle problem in the Rete network, has
sparked some serious thinking on my part. When I first started the project I 1)
read Forgy's paper for an introduction; 2) closely studied two existing Rete
implementations (Jess, CLIPS); then 3) borrowed aspects from both and put
together a CLOS implementation. The plan was to use this initial version as a test bed
of sorts until I thoroughly understood the algorithm, but LISA acquired some
early users and I concentrated on feature work instead. Now I find myself with a
bug in an area of LISA that falls into the &quot;why was this particular design
path chosen&quot;, and I can't answer that question and can't immediately solve
the problem.<br>
<br>
So, I have decided it's time to overhaul the project. I'm going to do several
things:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Branch the development tree and create a LISA 2.0 path.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Reorganize the code base such that it will support multiple matching
      algorithms (much work here).<br>
    </li>
    <li>Return to Forgy's original paper and write, from scratch, a
      &quot;reference implementation&quot; in CLOS that represents the essence
      of Rete without some of the later optimizations used by Jess/CLIPS (join
      node sharing, etc.). I'll maintain the fast join node memories, but that's
      it for optimization in the RI.<br>
    </li>
    <li>By this time I should completely grok Rete and be able to enhance and
      fix LISA's current algorithm.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Once these things have been done LISA will be in a position to support other
algorithms; experimental versions of Rete, TREAT (maybe), whatever. They will
simply &quot;plug in&quot; to the engine framework and &quot;just run&quot;.<br>
<br>
Now, what is the impact here? I intend to suspend all work on 1.x; there simply
is no time to do the overhaul plus add new features to that trunk.<br>
This probably means no more bug fixes to 1.x unless someone is <i>really</i>
desperate. Since that's not likely I don't anticipate a problem here.</p>
<p>

<i>6 August, 2002</i>: Release 1.3.1 is out. This is a bugfix release that
addresses a significant problem with LISA's support for class hierarchy
reasoning. There are also a few enhancements and modifications. See the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/lisa/lisa/ChangeLog?rev=HEAD&amp;only_with_tag=Release_1-3-1&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">
ChangeLog</a> in the distribution for details. For anonymous CVS users, the release
tag for 1.3.1 is Release_1-3-1.</p>
<p>

<i>22 July, 2002</i>: LISA release 1.3 is now available. See the project
ChangeLog for details; there are numerous significant changes and enhancements.</p>
<p>

<i>1 June, 2002</i>: There's a release 1.3 on the horizon, incorporating major

overhauls in several areas. Among the changes,</p>

<ol>

  <li><i>Release snapshots</i>: I've decided to begin releasing interim

    snapshots that will be available via anonymous CVS through the LISA project

    page. I know of at least one individual that acquires LISA this way via the

    release tags I've applied to the code base. This is a clean way to offer

    early access to upcoming releases without cluttering up the download page

    with tons of transient files.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>Internal fact representation</i>: I've merged the CLOS and template

    representations of facts into a single model. Gone are SHADOW-FACTS and

    separate methods of handling DEFTEMPLATE and DEFIMPORT facts. A unified view

    is now in place. The immediate ramifications are 1) queries now function

    with both types of facts, as LISA creates a class representing each template

    and instantiates it for each fact; 2) the ASSERT macro can be used with

    DEFIMPORTS, in addition to the traditional ASSERT-INSTANCE. Point (2) was a

    surprising side-effect; I hadn't anticipated this.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>DEFIMPORT changes</i>: DEFIMPORT has been completely rewritten and

    simplified. The new specification requires only a class name and an optional

    keyword argument that indicates whether or not the class hierarchy should be

    considered during pattern matching. By default, LISA will make available all

    slots and all classes in the hierarchy. This change will break existing

    code, but I believe the simplified interface is much improved and makes

    better sense.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>Documentation</i>: The code base is being completely documented. I've

    only done a handful of files but work is proceeding. A tedious but necessary

    task, and it is reacquainting me with aspects of LISA that have been stable

    for over a year.<br>

    <br>

  </li>

  <li><i>MP support</i>: I want to remove MP synchronization code from LISA, and

    place the burden of multi-thread access on the developer (for now). My

    current approach to MP is not the way it should be done. This doesn't mean

    LISA won't be re-entrant; multiple threads may be in LISA as long as each

    thread is operating on a different inference engine instance. However, if an

    application has several threads that operate concurrently within <i>the same</i>

    engine then the application must manage synchronization. No more than one

    thread may be running within the same engine at any one time. To assist

    developers here, the macro WITH-INFERENCE-ENGINE will remain, and I'll also

    export a special variable, representing the &quot;active inference

    engine&quot;, that may be let-bound. In the future, I might employ the

    concept of multiple working memories; i.e. each thread would own its working

    memory and thus multiple threads could be running concurrently within the

    same engine. This will need exploration.</li>

</ol>

<p>

<i>18 May, 2002</i>: I've decided to change the way facts are represented

internally. Currently, LISA makes a distinction between facts defined by <i>deftemplate</i>

and facts represented as CLOS instances, primarily for a bit of efficiency when

CLOS reasoning isn't required. However, this makes things a bit mushy internally

and prohibits the use of queries on template facts. As of release 1.3, <i>all</i>

facts will be backed by a corresponding CLOS instance. A little bit of

performance will be sacrificed for a cleaner implementation and fully functional

queries. Along the way I'm also probably going to simplify the syntax of <i>defimport</i>.

Details in an upcoming update.</p>

<p>

<i>16 April, 2002</i>: Release 1.2 is out, and I've taken a step back to

survey the project. LISA has been in development now for about eighteen

months. In the beginning, I had this (probably unrealistic) notion that

LISA would grow to be some type of Grand Unified Agent Development Platform

for Lisp. Lately however, I've begun to see LISA as something more modest

and practical; a relatively light, clean inference engine for small to

medium scale Lisp applications that would benefit from production rule

technology. The fact that I'm the sole developer probably has something

to do with this philosophical shift (if indeed it is a shift); there's

only so much time to go around. Rather than move on to new feature work

for version 1.3, I've decided to pause development and concentrate on fully

documenting the source code. If someone needs some capability in LISA and

just can't wait I'll consider revising my plans, but for now documentation

and cleanup is my principal immediate goal.</p>

arises. NB: If your favorite Lisp/Environment/Tool was omitted here it

was done without prejudice; I simply haven't had time to test LISA with

every mainstream Lisp implementation, or investigate every knowledge representation

system, or... you get the idea.
