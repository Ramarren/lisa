<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>The Lisa Project</H2>
<P><BR>Welcome to the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">Lisa</A>
project, a platform for the development of <B>L</B>isp-based
<B>I</B>ntelligent <B>S</B>oftware <B>A</B>gents. Lisa is a
production-rule system implemented in the Common Lisp Object System
(CLOS), and is heavily influenced by CLIPS and the Java Expert System
Shell (JESS). At its core is a reasoning engine based on an
object-oriented implementation of the Rete algorithm, a very
efficient mechanism for solving the difficult many-to-many matching
problem (&quot;Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many
Object Pattern Match Problem&quot;, Charles L. Forgy, Artificial
Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.) Intrinsic to Lisa is the ability to
reason over CLOS objects without imposing special class hierarchy
requirements; thus it should be possible to easily augment existing
CLOS applications with reasoning capabilities. As Lisa is an
extension to Common Lisp, the full power of the Lisp environment is
always available. Lisa-enabled applications should run on any
ANSI-compliant Common Lisp platform. 
</P>
<H3>Project Goals</H3>
<P>The Lisa project is driven by a number of important goals: 
</P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P><I>Unrestricted availability</I>: The principal motivation
	for beginning Lisa was the apparent dearth of lightweight, <I>current,
	freely-available</I> toolkits for constructing Lisp-based
	intelligent systems. There are a number of very fine commercial and
	restricted-use products out there (see the links below), but these
	systems do not necessarily address the needs of developers
	attempting to introduce Lisp into their organizations. This is
	exactly the position I found myself in prior to Lisa. I was leading
	an applied research project that needed an expert system shell, and
	if I'd had a modern implementation freely available for Lisp I might
	have been able to successfully entrench Lisp within the
	organization. So, I wrote Lisa. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Portability</I>: Vendor neutrality is a significant
	project goal, not because I disapprove of commercial software but to
	ensure Lisa is available on as many platforms as I can manage.. As
	previously mentioned, Lisa is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp;
	currently, all development is being done on Windows 2000 using&nbsp;
	<A HREF="http://www.xanalys.com/">Xanalys</A>' LispWorks. Every
	effort will be made to avoid the use of implementation-specific
	functionality; in the cases where a non-ANSI feature must be used
	(e.g. multiprocessing support), Lisa will attempt to support the
	major Lisp implementations either through conditional evaluation or
	the use of a common library such as <A HREF="http://clocc.sourceforge.net/">CLOCC</A>.
		</P>
	<LI><P><I>Familiarity</I>: Lisa's production-rule system has its
	roots in CLIPS and JESS, making it readily familiar to developers
	who've worked with either of these systems. Indeed, the CLIPS and
	JESS languages both have their roots in Lisp. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Flexibility</I>: As previously mentioned, Lisa reasons
	over CLOS objects without requiring changes to an application's
	class hierarchy. In addition, the full power of Common Lisp is
	available for use within productions; there is no dichotomy between
	Lisa's programming language and her implementation. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><I>Simplicity</I>: Along with portability, the project is
	striving for simplicity and elegance at the functional, architecture
	and source code levels. This doesn't mean Lisa should have limited
	usefulness; rather, it should be possible for new developers to
	easily understand the code layout and behavior. Unless performance
	absolutely demands otherwise, clarity of design and implementation
	will take precedence. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Project People</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>

	Presently a knowledge engineer at a small startup in RTP, North
	Carolina. 
	</P>
</UL>
<H3>Project Status</H3>
<P>Release 3.2 is the latest official release. The major addition
after version 2.1 is support for Certainty Factors (CF), as described
in Peter Norvig's <I>Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence
Programming</I>. There's also a simplified install facility based on
ASDF, and some major performance improvements.</P>
<P>The first production release for Lisa 2.0, a major rewrite of the
system, was available as of 9 December, 2002. The Rete algorithm was
re-implemented from scratch; new conditional elements were added;
contexts were introduced; and a production rule debugger made
available. There were also other features not listed here. 
</P>
<P>Lisa had its first production release (Version 1.0) on 31 August,
2001 and is considered &quot;stable&quot; software; it should now be
possible to develop reasonably sophisticated knowledge bases for
&quot;real systems&quot;. Lisa has successfully run adaptations of
the &quot;monkey and bananas&quot; (MAB) planning problem on all four
target Lisp platforms, and full reasoning capabilities are available
for CLOS objects in a multi-threaded environment. Release 1.1 offers
support for <I>dynamic rule definition</I>, the ability to create new
rules from existing rules at runtime; version 1.2 includes a new
query facility that allows interactive and programmatic retrieval of
CLOS instances from a knowledge base. For the most current
information on the project, including mailing lists, latest news and
available downloads, see the <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">official
project page</A>. If you prefer, you may contact the project staff
directly (see <I>Project People</I>).</P>
<H3>Supported Platforms</H3>
<P>Lisa is known to run on LispWorks, ACL, CLISP, CMUCL (19a), SBCL
and OpenMCL. I also know of an individual that has managed to get
Lisa running on Armed Bear Common Lisp, a testimony to the quality of
that member of the Common Lisp family.</P>
<H3>Documentation</H3>
<P>Currently, documentation for Lisa is a work-in-progress. However,
there is a beta-quality version of the <A HREF="ref-guide.html">Lisa</A>
<A HREF="ref-guide.html">Reference Guide</A> that should help you get
started. Also, you may see the source code for Lisa's two versions of
the MAB, <A HREF="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab.lisp">mab.lisp</A>
and <A HREF="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab-clos.lisp">mab-clos.lisp</A>
(a &quot;CLOS-ified&quot; version of the default MAB implementation).
</P>
<H3>License</H3>
<P>Lisa is currently released under the GNU Lesser General Public
License (LGPL), primarily because it seemed more versatile than the
GPL. However, some sources indicate that the LGPL might inhibit
commercial uses of Lisp applications like Lisa. I've no idea if this
is the case as I'm not a legal expert. So, if you're interested in
using Lisa commercially and decide the LGPL gets in the way, feel
free to contact me to discuss some other type of license arrangement.</P>
<H3>News</H3>
<P><I>8 September, 2007:</I> <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">Release
3.0. This is a major release that offers support for certainty
factors, big performance improvements, and some important bug fixes.</SPAN></P>
<P><I>21 February, 2006:</I> Release 2.4. This is a minor release
that makes Lisa compatible with CLISP 2.38.</P>
<P><I>5 April, 2005:</I> Release 2.3. This version fixes a serious
bug in Lisa’s join network; thanks to Andy Sloane for the patch.
There’s also a patch from Fred Gilham that enables auto-notify
support for CMUCL.</P>
<P><I>4 April, 2005: </I>Release 2.1 is out of beta and is the latest
stable release.</P>
<P><I>17 September, 2004</I>: Release 2.1 beta is available, with
support for Certainty Factors. Also, Lisa now unofficially once again
supports CMUCL. I've had reports that the PCL bugs were fixed as of
19a, and that Lisa is able to run the MAB on that platform.</P>
<P><I>9 June, 2004</I>: Lisa now uses ASDF as its default system
definition facility. The build and load procedure has also been
simplified to help new folks get up and running quickly. I also have
plans to write a tutorial that will be more useful than the reference
guide. Also, note that Lisa officially no longer supports CMUCL.
There's apparently a bug in PCL that prevents Lisa from running (or
perhaps compiling; I forget). This situation has existed for awhile
now, but I'm just getting around to announcing it.</P>
<P><I>6 June, 2004</I>: Release 2.0.7. Yet another bug-fix release
that corrects a problem reported by Aneil Mallavarapu. Lisa was
having difficulty keeping the agenda straight when rules were created
after facts had been asserted into working memory.</P>
<P><I>5 March, 2004</I>: Release 2.0.6. This is a bug-fix release
that addresses problems with a) Lisa's duplicate fact detection
mechanism; and b) the LOGICAL conditional element. Patches for both
issues were submitted by Aneil Mallavarapu.</P>
<P><I>1 November, 2003</I>: Release 2.0.5, a bug-fix release that
corrects problems with Lisa’s taxonomic reasoning system. Patches
submitted courtesy of Aneil Mallavarapu.</P>
<P><I>19 December, 2002</I>: Release 2.0.3, a bug-fix release
addressing a problem with queries. 
</P>
<P><I>10 December, 2002</I>: Release 2.0.1, a bug-fix release for
2.0.</P>
<P><I>9 December, 2002</I>: The first production release for 2.0 is
available. Details are in the <A HREF="RELNOTES.html">release notes</A>.</P>
<P><I>25 November, 2002</I>: Beta 3 is available. Again, some major
enhancements, including Contexts, a new conditional element and
duplicate fact detection. Details are in the release notes.</P>
<P><I>18 November, 2002</I>: Beta 2 is available. Lots of changes and
enhancements in this version, including completion of Lisa's truth
maintenance system. See the <A HREF="RELNOTES.html">release notes</A>
for details.</P>
<P><I>6 November, 2002</I>: The first beta release for Lisa 2.0,
2.0b1. This version introduces a form of truth maintenance via the
LOGICAL conditional element. Details are in the reference guide in
the distribution.</P>
<P><I>4 November, 2002</I>: Alpha release 5 for Lisa 2.0 is now
available. This version introduces the OR conditional element, along
with some improvements to the debugger. Details are in the reference
guide in the distribution.</P>
<P><I>28 October, 2002</I>: Alpha release 4 for Lisa 2.0 is now
available. New to this version is the Lisa debugger, a simple,
interactive production rule monitoring/inspection facility. The
Reference Guide in the distribution has a chapter explaining how to
use it.</P>

<H3>Related Links</H3>
<P>This section contains a small collection of topics related to Lisa
and its development environment. It will be updated periodically as
the need arises. NB: If your favorite Lisp/Environment/Tool was
omitted here it was done without prejudice; I simply haven't had time
to test Lisa with every mainstream Lisp implementation, or
investigate every knowledge representation system, or... you get the
idea. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp;
