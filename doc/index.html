<b>LISA - Intelligent Software Agents for Common Lisp</b></h2></center>



<p><br>Welcome to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">LISA</a>

project, a platform for the development of <b>L</b>isp-based <b>I</b>ntelligent

<b>S</b>oftware

<b>A</b>gents.

LISA is a production-rule system implemented in the Common Lisp Object

System (CLOS), and is heavily influenced by CLIPS and the Java Expert System

Shell (JESS). At its core is a reasoning engine based on an object-oriented

implementation of the Rete algorithm, a very efficient mechanism for solving

the difficult many-to-many matching problem ("Rete: A Fast Algorithm for

the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem", Charles L. Forgy,

Artificial Intelligence 19(1982), 17-37.) Intrinsic to LISA is the ability

to reason over CLOS objects without imposing special class hierarchy requirements;

thus it should be possible to easily augment existing CLOS applications

with reasoning capabilities. As LISA is an extension to Common Lisp, the

full power of the Lisp environment is always available. LISA-enabled applications

should run on any ANSI-compliant Common Lisp platform.

<h3>

<b>Project Goals</b></h3>

The LISA project is driven by a number of important goals:

<ul>

<li>

<i>Unrestricted availability</i>: The principal motivation for beginning

LISA was the apparent dearth of lightweight, <i>current, freely-available</i>

toolkits for constructing Lisp-based intelligent systems. There are a number

of very fine commercial and restricted-use products out there (see the

links below), but these systems do not necessarily address the needs of

the Open Source community.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Portability</i>: Vendor neutrality is a significant project goal. As

previously mentioned, LISA is implemented in ANSI Common Lisp; currently,

all development is being done on Linux using&nbsp; <a href="http://www.xanalys.com">Xanalys</a>'

LispWorks and <a href="http://www.franz.com">Franz</a>'s Allegro Common

Lisp. In addition, concurrent validation is performed with&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl">CMU

Common Lisp</a> (CMUCL) and <a href="http://clisp.cons.org">CLISP</a>&nbsp;

to gain more complete coverage. Every effort will be made to avoid the

use of implementation-specific functionality; in the cases where a non-ANSI

feature must be used (e.g. multiprocessing support), LISA will attempt

to support the major Lisp implementations either through conditional evaluation

or the use of a common library such as <a href="http://clocc.sourceforge.net">CLOCC</a>.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Familiarity</i>: LISA's production-rule system has its roots in CLIPS

and JESS, making it readily familiar to developers who've worked with either

of these systems. Indeed, the CLIPS and JESS languages both have their

roots in Lisp.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Flexibility</i>: As previously mentioned, LISA reasons over CLOS objects

without requiring changes to an application's class hierarchy. In addition,

the full power of Common Lisp is available for use within productions;

there is no dichotomy between LISA's programming language and her implementation.</li>



<br>&nbsp;

<li>

<i>Simplicity</i>: Along with portability, the project is striving for

simplicity and elegance at the functional, architecture and source code

levels. This doesn't mean LISA should have limited usefulness; rather,

it should be possible for new developers to easily understand the code

layout

and behavior. Unless performance absolutely demands otherwise, clarity

of design and implementation will take precedence.</li>

<h3>

Project Status</h3>

Work is continuing toward a production release for LISA 2.0, a major rewrite of
the system. The Rete algorithm has been re-implemented from scratch; new
conditional elements have been added; contexts have been introduced; and a production rule debugger is now
available.
<p>

LISA had its first production release (Version 1.0) on 31 August, 2001

and is considered "stable" software; it should now be possible to develop

reasonably sophisticated knowledge bases for Real Systems. LISA has successfully

run adaptations of the "monkey and bananas" (MAB) planning problem on all

four target Lisp platforms, and full reasoning capabilities are available

for CLOS objects in a multi-threaded environment. Release 1.1 offers support

for <i>dynamic rule definition</i>, the ability to create new rules from

existing rules at runtime; version 1.2 includes a new query facility that

allows interactive and programmatic retrieval of CLOS instances from a knowledge

base. For the most current information on the project, including

mailing lists, latest news and available downloads, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lisa">official

project page</a>. If you prefer, you may contact the project staff directly

(see

<i>Project People</i>).</p>

<h3>

Documentation</h3>

Currently, documentation for LISA is a work-in-progress. However, there

is a beta-quality version of the <a href="ref-guide.html">LISA Reference

Guide</a> that should help you get started. Also, you may see the source

code for LISA's two versions of the MAB, <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab.lisp">mab.lisp</a>

and <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab-clos.lisp">mab-clos.lisp</a>

(a "CLOS-ified" version of the default MAB implementation).

<h3>

News</h3>

<i>25 November, 2002</i>: Beta 3 is available. Again, some major enhancements,
including Contexts, a new conditional element and duplicate fact detection.
Details are in the release notes.
<p>

<i>18 November, 2002</i>: Beta 2 is available. Lots of changes and enhancements
in this version, including completion of LISA's truth maintenance system. See
the <a href="RELNOTES.html">release notes</a> for details.</p>
<p>

<i>6 November, 2002</i>: The first beta release for LISA 2.0, 2.0b1. This
version introduces a form of truth maintenance via the LOGICAL conditional
element. Details are in the reference guide in the distribution.</p>
<p>

<i>4 November, 2002</i>: Alpha release 5 for LISA 2.0 is now available. This
version introduces the OR conditional element, along with some improvements to
the debugger. Details are in the reference guide in the distribution.</p>
<p>

<i>28 October, 2002</i>: Alpha release 4 for LISA 2.0 is now available. New to
this version is the LISA debugger, a simple, interactive production rule
monitoring/inspection facility. The Reference Guide in the distribution has a
chapter explaining how to use it.</p>

This section contains a small collection of topics related to LISA and its development environment. It will be updated periodically as the need

arises. NB: If your favorite Lisp/Environment/Tool was omitted here it

was done without prejudice; I simply haven't had time to test LISA with

every mainstream Lisp implementation, or investigate every knowledge representation

system, or... you get the idea.
