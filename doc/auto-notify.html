<h1>LISA 2.0</h1>
<h3>5 December, 2002</h3>
<h3>Auto Notification</h3>
<p>For Common Lisps with complete, or mostly complete, MOP implementations, LISA
offers an experimental feature called “auto notification”. This mechanism
may be used to monitor changes to CLOS instances in working memory that occur
outside of LISA (i.e. somewhere else in the application, and not via the <i>modify</i>
macro). Normally, LISA must be explicitly told about these changes via the
function <i>lisa:mark-instance-as-changed</i>; when an application alters the
contents of an instance’s slots, it informs LISA about the changes so the
inference engine can maintain the consistency of working memory. Auto
Notification obviates this requirement; LISA hooks into the MOP slot access
protocol and notices slot changes without application intervention. Like just
about anything worthwhile, however, the benefits of this feature come at a small
price. Any user-defined class participating in Auto Notification must, at a
minimum, have as its metaclass <i>lisa:standard-kb-class</i>. For example:</p>
<dl>
  <dd>(defclass frodo ()<br>
    &nbsp; ((name :accessor frodo-name))<br>
    &nbsp; (:metaclass lisa:standard-kb-class))</dd>
</dl>
<p>There may also be implementation-specific needs that further constrain users
of Auto Notification. In general, however, the use of the aforementioned
metaclass is all that’s required.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Auto Notification has been tested with Allegro Common
Lisp 6.2 and Lispworks 4.2. CLISP does not have a MOP implementation of
sufficient depth, and I have not yet attempted a version for CMUCL (I would
welcome a submission). Regarding the two commercial Common Lisps supported by
LISA, their implementations of Auto Notification are described below, listing
any additional requirements beyond the use of <i>lisa:standard-kb-class</i>.</p>
<h3>ACL 6.2</h3>
<p>LISA implements Auto Notification for Allegro by adding an <i>around</i>
method on <i>make-instance</i>, and an <i>after</i> method on <i>(setf
slot-value-using-class)</i>. Whether an application alters a slot via its writer
method or a direct invocation of <i>(setf slot-value)</i>, LISA notices the
change and reacts accordingly. Note carefully, however, that I’ve only tested
this with the default compiler optimization settings, under version 6.2. Due to
my experience with Lispworks (see below), it remains to be seen whether the
current implementation for ACL will hold.</p>
<h3>Lispworks 4.2</h3>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">Auto Notification for Lispworks is a bit more
complicated than the ACL version, because the Lispworks compiler appears to
optimize methods containing calls to <i>slot-value</i>, such that the standard
MOP slot access protocol is bypassed. Therefore, the implementation used for ACL
won’t work here. Instead, LISA must iterate through the writer methods of all
classes whose metaclass is <i>lisa:standard-kb-class</i> and attach special <i>after</i>
methods on their generic functions; these special methods respond to slot
changes and notify LISA accordingly. To create these methods, LISA installs an <i>after
</i>method on <i>initialize-instance</i>, specialized on <i>lisa:standard-kb-class</i>,
that does most of the work. <b>As a result, applications wishing to use Auto
Notification with Lispworks must ensure that all class slots that might be
referenced by rules have corresponding writer methods</b>. Altering a slot’s
contents by direct calls to <i>(setf slot-value)</i> will bypass Auto
Notification and corrupt the inference engine’s working memory. This
constraint is in addition to the metaclass requirement described previously.</span></p>
