The Zebu runtime system is all you need if you want to use the
parser/generator that was produced by the compiler (in form of a .tab
file).

The Zebu-compiler is necessary in order to convert the external
grammar description (in form of a .zb file) into a LALR(1) parsing
table (in form of a .tab file), and associated printers and semantic
functions (in form of a <grammar-name>-domain.lisp file).

Installation
------------

1. Check whether the pathname for the Zebu directory is correct in your
installation.

2. If you have a Common Lisp compiler

	(load "COMPILE-ZEBU.lisp")

This compiles all of ZEBU.

3. To use ZEBU evaluate

	(load "ZEBU-init.lisp")

3.1 if you have a  Common Lisp compiler

	(zb:zebu)                ; to load the runtime system

	(zb:zebu-compiler)       ; to load the grammar compiler

	(zb:zebu-rr)             ; to load the rewrite-rule module

3.2 If you don't have a Common Lisp compiler

	(zb:zebu :compiled nil)                ; to load the runtime system

	(zb:zebu-compiler :compiled nil)       ; to load the grammar compiler
