;;; Description: The "Tanks and Pumps" application, as adapted from the Java
;;; Expert System Shell (Jess). This is a pretty good test of LISA's MP
;;; support. 

;;; The basic scenario is a "tank" containing some liquid and a "pump"
;;; attached to the tank. There's a thread associated with the tank that acts
;;; as a consumer of the fluid; there's also a thread running the pump that
;;; restores fluid at an adjustable rate. There are two thresholds (high, low)
;;; at which point the system will attempt to compensate by decreasing or
;;; increasing the pumping rate. This behavior is implemented as a small set
;;; of rules. If the tank runs dry it catches fire; if the tank over-fills it
;;; explodes. As set up now, the simulation tends to fluctuate between both
;;; thresholds; by playing with the variables it's possible to see the tank
;;; destroy itself.

;;; To run the simulation, load this file and (from the LISA-USER package)
;;; evaluate (reset) and (run). Be default, the only output occurs during
;;; threshold crossings; for more feedback, bind the variable *verbose-output*
;;; to T before evaluating (run), as in
;;;
;;;   (let ((*verbose-output t))
;;;     (run))
