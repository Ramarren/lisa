This file is an ongoing record of development issues related to the
LISA project. It was (belatedly) started just after LISA's first alpha
release on 10 March, 2001; the intention is to record those
experiences I consider important enough to retain in long-term
memory. Things like cross-implementation discrepancies, milestones,
changes in project direction are all suitable candidates.

NB: As of 3.13.2001 LISA runs on four Common Lisp implementations:
LispWorks 4.1, ACL 5.0/6.0, CMUCL 18c and CLISP. Only the Linux
versions have been tested.

* 3.9.2001: LISA has her first alpha release. Just prior to this
  event I was asked to get LISA working on CLISP; doing so exposed
  some platform discrepancies that I am recording here.

  1. The function CLOS:CLASS-DIRECT-SLOTS is internal in CLISP,
     external in the others. This actually looks like a MOP issue.

  2. The method INITIALIZE-INSTANCE: CLISP seems to be much more
     strict vis-a-vis keyword arguments than the other Lisps. Perhaps
     CLISP might not be interpreting CLtL2 correctly here, or perhaps
     the other Lisps are too lax; it isn't completely clear to me from
     my reading. For example:

     (defclass rocky ()
       ((name :initarg :name
              :initform nil
              :reader get-name)
        (buddy :initform nil
              :reader get-buddy)))

     (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((self rocky) &key (buddy nil))
       (setf (slot-value self 'buddy) buddy))

     (defun make-rocky ()
       (make-instance 'rocky :name 'rocky))

     Evaluating MAKE-ROCKY in CLISP yields:

     *** - EVAL/APPLY: keyword :NAME is illegal for #<COMPILED-CLOSURE
           #:COMPILED-FORM-117-1>. The possible keywords are (:BUDDY)

     No complaints from the others.

     Adding &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS to INITIALIZE-METHOD allows CLISP to run
     without complaint, but of course disables keyword argument
     checking.

     ****** FIXED as of CLISP 2.25.1

   3. CLISP's implementation of LOAD doesn't understand logical
      pathnames. According to CLtL2 it should, but I haven't yet found
      this stated in the Hyperspec.

      ****** FIXED as of CLISP 2.25.1
