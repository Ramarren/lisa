<h2>The LISA Project</h2>
<p>1 October, 2002</p>
<p>This is the first alpha release for LISA version 2.0, representing a
significant improvement over the 1.x branch. At the core of 2.0 is a ground-up
rewrite of LISA's Rete algorithm. While CLOS still forms the basic structure of
the algorithm, 2.0 makes extensive use of closures and function objects,
yielding a more &quot;lispy&quot; feel to the implementation. The second
significant departure from 1.x is a redesigned language parser, with particular
attention paid to the analysis of DEFRULE forms. While the 1.x parser performs
multi-pass transformations over DEFRULEs, the new parser is a single-pass
implementation that collects more structural information &quot;up-front&quot;
before sending the output to the Rete compiler.</p>
<p>By incorporating the algorithmic and parsing changes mentioned above, a
significant amount of code has been eliminated from 2.0. In particular, the
entire 1.x binding mechanism, used to establish variable bindings in production
rules and support rule firings, has been replaced by closures. Closures also
form the basis of various types of intra- and inter-pattern node tests, making
possible a reduction in the number of classes required to implement nodes in the
Rete network. These two changes alone make for a dramatic improvement in code
readability, simplicity, and application performance.</p>
<p>Some features present in 1.x have not yet been adapted to 2.0. These are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rule redefinition, including runtime rule creation (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
    rule RHSs).</li>
  <li>Query support.</li>
  <li>Debugging support, including watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>This first alpha release is intended to give developers a chance to try their
rule sets with the new algorithm and parser, and expose any remaining bugs. LISA
2.0 is able to successfully run the sample MAB problems included in the
distribution, but exposure to other rule sets is vital to ensuring the stability
of forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 contains its own DEFSYSTEM file, lisa2.system. Building 2.0 is
very similar to how one builds 1.x; the system name is LISA2 rather than LISA.
So, something like (mk:compile-system :lisa2) should work for you.</p>
<p>This alpha version of 2.0 has been tested with ACL 6.2 and CLISP 2.29, both
on Windows 2000.</p>
