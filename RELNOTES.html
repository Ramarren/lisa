
<h1>Release Notes for LISA 2.0 (alpha)</h1>
<h2>The LISA Project</h2>
<h3>4 November, 2002</h3>
<p>Alpha release five. This version introduces the OR conditional element, along
with some improvements to the LISA debugger. The reference guide in the
distribution contains details.</p>
<h3>28 October, 2002</h3>
<p>Alpha release four. This version introduces the LISA debugger, a simple
monitoring and inspection facility for production rules. There is documentation
for this feature in the 2.0 reference guide. Well, it's actually the 1.x guide
with debugger documentation grafted in. I haven't yet gone through the document and updated it for the rest of 2.0.</p>
<h3>20 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the third alpha release for LISA version 2.0, following closely on
the heels of 2.0a2 because I had a bit more time than anticipated to spend on
it. The last remaining missing 1.x features have been added; these are 1) a
basic watch mechanism; and 2) embedded rule definitions (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
rule RHSs). The 2.0 branch remains a much improved implementation over 1.x, and
should offer a solid foundation for any future LISA development.</p>
<h3>17 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the second alpha release for LISA version 2.0. Rule redefinition and
queries are now in place, with improved performance and efficiency. In the case
of rule redefinition, or rule insertion into a &quot;live&quot; engine, LISA now
builds a &quot;mini Rete network&quot; for the new rule and grafts it into the
larger network. Also new are rewritten ASSERT and MODIFY macros, allowing code
similar to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
  <dl>
    <dt>(let ((?age 1000))</dt>
    <dt>&nbsp; (modify ?fact (age ?age) (name (make-a-name))))</dt>
  </dl>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, ASSERT and MODIFY should now respond better to their lexical
environments.</p>
<h3>1 October, 2002</h3>
<p>This is the first alpha release for LISA version 2.0, representing a
significant improvement over the 1.x branch. At the core of 2.0 is a ground-up
rewrite of LISA's Rete algorithm. While CLOS still forms the basic structure of
the algorithm, 2.0 makes extensive use of closures and function objects,
yielding a more &quot;lispy&quot; feel to the implementation. The second
significant departure from 1.x is a redesigned language parser, with particular
attention paid to the analysis of DEFRULE forms. While the 1.x parser performs
multi-pass transformations over DEFRULEs, the new parser is a single-pass
implementation that collects more structural information &quot;up-front&quot;
before sending the output to the Rete compiler.</p>
<p>By incorporating the algorithmic and parsing changes mentioned above, a
significant amount of code has been eliminated from 2.0. In particular, the
entire 1.x binding mechanism, used to establish variable bindings in production
rules and support rule firings, has been replaced by closures. Closures also
form the basis of various types of intra- and inter-pattern node tests, making
possible a reduction in the number of classes required to implement nodes in the
Rete network. These two changes alone make for a dramatic improvement in code
readability, simplicity, and application performance.</p>
<p>Some features present in 1.x have not yet been adapted to 2.0. These are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rule redefinition, including runtime rule creation (i.e. DEFRULE forms on
    rule RHSs).</li>
  <li>Query support.</li>
  <li>Debugging support, including watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>This first alpha release is intended to give developers a chance to try their
rule sets with the new algorithm and parser, and expose any remaining bugs. LISA
2.0 is able to successfully run the sample MAB problems included in the
distribution, but exposure to other rule sets is vital to ensuring the stability
of forthcoming releases.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 contains its own DEFSYSTEM file, lisa2.system. Building 2.0 is
very similar to how one builds 1.x; the system name is LISA2 rather than LISA.
So, something like (mk:compile-system :lisa2) should work for you. The 2.0 code
base is kept separate from 1.x; you'll notice two new directories in the source
tree; 2.0-core contains the core system files, rete/reference contains those
files strictly associated with the 2.0 Rete implementation.</p>
<p>This alpha version of 2.0 has been tested with ACL 6.2 and CLISP 2.29, both
on Windows 2000.</p>
